Python: When to Use len()

The len() function works on sequences and collections, such as:

len() does NOT work on integers or floats:

Use len() only on objects that have a length (sequences, collections).

Python: Arithmetic Operators

%  (modulo): Returns the remainder after division.
    Example: 7 % 3 = 1

/  (division): Returns the floating-point result of division.
    Example: 7 / 3 = 2.333...

// (floor division): Returns the integer part of division (floored).
    Example: 7 // 3 = 2

Python: Accumulators – Sum vs Collection
----------------------------------------
• To accumulate a sum, use an integer variable (e.g., total = 0) and add to it with total += value.
• To collect values, use a list variable (e.g., acc = []) and add items with acc.append(value).
• You cannot add an integer directly to a list with +=; use append() for lists and += for numbers.
• Choose accumulator type based on your goal: sum (integer) or collection (list).
